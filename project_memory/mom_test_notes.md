**Mom Test Interview Notes**

*DeepWork --- Pomodoro Timer for Deep Work*

Project 2 \| Qi (Dako) Wei & Lipeipei Sun \| February 2026

**Methodology & Context**

All three interviews were conducted following Mom Test principles:
questions focused on past behavior, current workflows, and real pain
points --- never on opinions about the proposed product. Interviewees
were not told the product concept until after the core questions were
complete. No hypothetical future-tense questions were asked.

**Key questions used across all interviews:**

-   Walk me through the last time you had a really productive day. What
    made it work?

-   Walk me through the last time you tried to do focused work and it
    fell apart. What happened?

-   Have you ever tried any tools to manage your focus or track your
    time? Tell me about that.

-   What do you do during breaks? Walk me through your last break.

-   How do you know at the end of the day whether it was productive?
    Walk me through that.

-   What have you tried to fix this? What happened?

**Interview 1**

  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  **Field**             **Details**

  Interviewee           Graduate student, 27

  Date                  February 10, 2026

  Duration              28 minutes

  Setting               Coffee shop --- their usual study environment

  Method                In-person, casual conversation. Product not
                        mentioned until post-interview.
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------

**Background**

-   PhD student in computational biology, year 2

-   Juggles three overlapping responsibilities: coursework, lab
    research, and TAing

-   Studies in coffee shops, libraries, and at home; describes home as
    \"the hardest place to focus\"

-   Has used phone timers and tried one Pomodoro app (Forest) for about
    two weeks before stopping

**Current Workflow (Observed, Not Reported)**

When asked to walk through a typical study session, the interviewee
described starting with a loose intention (\"I\'ll work on my lit review
for a while\") but no fixed time boundary. They open their laptop, check
Slack first, then switch between the actual work and a browser tab with
Reddit or email, typically without noticing the transition.

When asked about their phone timer habit: they set it to 25 minutes, but
described dismissing it \"basically every time\" when they\'re in the
middle of a paragraph or a thought. After dismissing it, they lose track
of time entirely --- the timer\'s interruption paradoxically makes
tracking worse, not better.

**Past Behavior --- Specific Incidents**

**Incident 1: The Toggl Experiment**

About eight months ago, the interviewee tried Toggl after a friend
recommended it. They used it for approximately one week. The friction
point: they had to manually start and stop timers for each task switch,
which required them to be meta-aware of what they were doing in real
time. They stopped because logging retroactively felt like \"making
stuff up\" and the overhead didn\'t feel worth the data it produced.

> *\"I kept filling it in at the end of the day from memory. That\'s
> just guessing. I stopped because it felt dishonest --- the data
> wasn\'t real anyway.\"*

**Incident 2: The Forest App**

Used Forest for about two weeks, drawn in by the gamification. Stopped
for two reasons: (1) the 25-minute block was too short for research
reading --- \"by the time you\'re into something, it\'s over\" --- and
(2) the forced break felt punitive when they were in flow. They felt the
app was designed for someone else\'s work style.

**Incident 3: The Bad Break**

When asked to describe the last break they took, they described picking
up their phone to \"check one thing\" and emerging 40 minutes later
having watched YouTube and scrolled Instagram. This is their default
break behavior. They know it\'s not restorative but described having
\"no idea what else to do.\" They mentioned feeling guilty after --- the
break made them more anxious, not less.

**Pain Points (Validated)**

-   Session interruptions at the wrong moment are worse than no timer
    --- they cause context loss without providing recovery

-   Manual logging requires real-time meta-awareness of task-switching,
    which is incompatible with deep work

-   Breaks default to phone-based distraction with no alternative
    readily available

-   No reliable signal at end of day for how productive the session
    actually was vs. how long it was

-   No visibility into where time goes across projects or subjects

**Key Quotes**

> *\"I ignore it. I can\'t just stop in the middle of understanding
> something. So I kill the timer and then I lose track of time
> completely.\"*
>
> *\"I tried tracking my time for a week. I kept logging it
> retroactively which is just guessing. I stopped because it felt like
> more work than it was worth.\"*
>
> *\"Breaks are just phone time. I don\'t know what else to do with
> them. And then I feel worse after.\"*

**Interviewer Assessment**

Strong signal. This interviewee has genuinely tried to solve the problem
--- they didn\'t just complain, they experimented with multiple tools
and abandoned them for specific, articulable reasons. The abandonment
pattern is particularly useful: not \"it didn\'t work\" but \"the mental
model was wrong for my actual workflow.\" The break behavior surfaced
unprompted and was clearly a real pain point, not a performance for the
interviewer.

**Mom Test Quality Check:** All data from past behavior and specific
incidents. Zero hypotheticals accepted. One attempt to pitch the product
concept was deflected.

**Interview 2**

  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  **Field**             **Details**

  Interviewee           Mid-level software engineer, 31

  Date                  February 12, 2026

  Duration              35 minutes

  Setting               Video call --- interviewee working remotely that
                        day

  Method                Remote, semi-structured. Interviewee\'s screen
                        was shared for first 5 minutes to observe their
                        workspace setup.
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------

**Background**

-   Full-stack engineer at a mid-size SaaS company, 4 years experience

-   Works in-office 3 days/week, remote 2 days; describes in-office days
    as \"reactive\" and remote days as \"deep work days, in theory\"

-   Never used a Pomodoro timer --- explicitly considered standard
    25-minute intervals \"not designed for engineering\"

-   Uses company time-tracking for billable hours but finds it useless
    for personal productivity insight

**Current Workflow**

The interviewee works in self-described \"variable blocks\" --- no
structured timer, just working until a natural stopping point or an
interruption. They batch PR reviews separately from feature development
because \"they require completely different brain modes.\" Feature work
they protect; reviews happen in whatever gaps exist.

Context restoration after interruptions is a real system they\'ve
developed: they leave voice memos to themselves describing where they
were and what the next step is. This was unprompted and suggests
genuine, habituated behavior around a real problem.

**Past Behavior --- Specific Incidents**

**Incident 1: The Worst Week**

Asked to describe a recent week that felt unproductive, the interviewee
described a sprint where they closed 12 tickets but felt like they\'d
accomplished nothing meaningful. On reflection, almost all of them were
small bug fixes and review requests, none longer than 45 minutes of
focused work. They had no data to confirm this --- it was a feeling,
later corroborated by a retrospective comment from their manager.

> *\"I can see commits, I can see tickets closed, but I couldn\'t tell
> you if I worked 6 deep hours or 2 deep hours and 4 hours of context
> switching.\"*

**Incident 2: The Voice Memo System**

When asked how they handle interruptions, they showed (on screen share)
a folder of voice memos on their phone with titles like \"auth refactor
next step\" and \"where I was on the WebSocket bug.\" They estimated
they record 2-3 per day on busy days. This is a self-built workaround
for context-switching loss --- not a preference, a coping mechanism.

**Incident 3: The Break That Never Happened**

When asked about the last deliberate break they took during a workday,
there was a notable pause. They described getting up to refill coffee as
\"probably\" a break. When probed, they acknowledged they don\'t
intentionally take breaks --- they happen when eye strain or mental
blocks force them. On remote days they described sometimes working 4-5
hours without leaving their chair.

> *\"I don\'t really take breaks. I take accidental breaks when I stop
> being effective. That\'s how I know I need one.\"*

**Pain Points (Validated)**

-   Standard Pomodoro intervals are misaligned with engineering task
    types --- feature work requires longer, uninterrupted blocks

-   No mechanism to distinguish deep work hours from shallow/reactive
    hours in any existing tool

-   Context switching between task types (deep work vs. reviews) causes
    measurable flow disruption with no recovery support

-   Breaks are reactive rather than designed --- happen by accident or
    cognitive failure, never intentionally

-   Productivity proxies (commits, tickets) are a known imprecise
    substitute for actual deep work measurement

**Key Quotes**

> *\"25 minutes is meaningless for coding. You\'re just getting into it
> by then.\"*
>
> *\"I can see commits, I can see tickets closed, but I couldn\'t tell
> you if I worked 6 deep hours or 2 deep hours and 4 hours of context
> switching.\"*
>
> *\"I built my own little system for context restoration. Voice memos.
> It\'s dumb but it works better than trying to remember.\"*

**Interviewer Assessment**

Very strong signal. The voice memo system is the most compelling
behavioral evidence across all three interviews: this is someone who
identified a real problem (context loss from interruptions) and invested
effort in building a workaround. The absence of intentional breaks is
also notable --- not a casual complaint but a structural absence. The
distinction between deep work and shallow work hours was articulated
precisely and unprompted.

**Mom Test Quality Check:** Strong. Interviewee volunteered the voice
memo system unprompted --- no leading questions needed. The screen share
provided direct behavioral observation, not self-report.

**Interview 3**

  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  **Field**             **Details**

  Interviewee           Senior program manager, consulting firm, 38

  Date                  February 14, 2026

  Duration              40 minutes

  Setting               Phone call --- interviewee in their home office

  Method                Phone, casual framing. Presented as a
                        conversation about remote work habits.
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------

**Background**

-   Senior PM managing 2-3 client accounts simultaneously, fully remote
    for 3 years

-   Primary focus strategy is calendar blocking --- blocks 90-minute
    \"deep work\" slots in Outlook

-   Has never used a dedicated focus timer app --- considers them \"for
    students\"

-   Works from a dedicated home office but experiences frequent
    client-initiated interruptions

**Current Workflow**

The interviewee described a daily routine built around calendar blocking
--- setting Outlook appointments for herself labeled \"deep work\" to
signal unavailability to clients. In practice, these blocks are
overridden by client calls at least half the time. When they do hold,
she described a ritual: closing Slack, putting on headphones \"even
though no one can see me,\" and trying to start focused work.

The ritual is interesting: it functions as a psychological entry signal,
not a functional one. But mid-session email checking recurs out of
anxiety about missing urgent client messages --- the ritual breaks down
under sustained use.

**Past Behavior --- Specific Incidents**

**Incident 1: The Identical Days**

When asked to compare a productive day and an unproductive day from the
past two weeks, the interviewee paused for a significant time. She
eventually said they often feel indistinguishable in the moment. She
described a specific Thursday that felt exhausting and busy ---
back-to-back conversations, lots of Slack --- and at the end she
realized she had made zero progress on a client deliverable she\'d
intended to complete. She went home feeling productive because she\'d
been active, but the actual output was reactive work only.

> *\"I go by how tired I am, honestly. But sometimes I\'m exhausted just
> from being reactive all day and I got nothing real done. Those are the
> worst days.\"*

**Incident 2: The Sticky Note System**

Unprompted, she described using sticky notes to capture context before
interruptions --- writing down where she was and what she was about to
do next, so she can return to it after a client call. This is a direct
parallel to the software engineer\'s voice memo system: a self-built
context-restoration hack for a real, recurring problem.

**Incident 3: The Two-Hour Insight**

Late in the conversation, when asked how she\'d know when to take a
meaningful break, she described something unexpected: she doesn\'t think
in terms of individual sessions at all. She thinks in terms of total
accumulated focus time for the day. When probed, she said she would act
on a signal that told her she had hit two hours of actual focused work
--- not calendar time --- and should now take a real break.

> *\"I\'d actually use something that told me when I hit two hours of
> real focus --- not calendar time, actual focus time --- and said
> \'take a real break now.\'\"*

This insight was not prompted by any product description. It surfaced
organically from a question about her ideal end-of-day signal.

**Pain Points (Validated)**

-   Calendar blocking is a proxy for focus, not focus itself --- blocks
    are regularly overridden by client obligations

-   No reliable signal for when mental fatigue has crossed into
    diminishing returns on focused work

-   Busy days and productive days are experientially identical in the
    moment, diverging only in retrospect

-   No data to separate deep client work from administrative/reactive
    task time

-   Mental model of productivity is day-level accumulated focus, not
    session-level intervals --- existing tools don\'t match this

**Unique Insight --- Accumulated Focus vs. Session-Based Timers**

This participant does not think in terms of individual sessions. She
thinks about her day in terms of **total real focus time**. This mental
model is fundamentally incompatible with standard Pomodoro apps, which
are session-centric. The accumulated focus tracking feature in the
DeepWork proposal directly addresses this --- but it emerged from
research, not from product assumptions.

**Key Quotes**

> *\"I close Slack. I put on headphones even though no one can see me
> --- it\'s like a psychological signal to myself. Then halfway through
> I usually check my email because I\'m worried I\'m missing something
> urgent.\"*
>
> *\"I go by how tired I am, honestly. But sometimes I\'m exhausted just
> from being reactive all day and I got nothing real done. Those are the
> worst days.\"*
>
> *\"I\'d actually use something that told me when I hit two hours of
> real focus --- not calendar time, actual focus time --- and said
> \'take a real break now.\'\"*

**Interviewer Assessment**

Highest signal interview of the three. The accumulated focus insight is
the most important finding from all three conversations and was entirely
unprompted. The sticky note system confirms the context-restoration
problem is cross-persona. The inability to distinguish busy days from
productive days is articulated as a genuine daily frustration, not an
abstract complaint.

**Mom Test Quality Check:** Excellent. The two-hour accumulated focus
insight came from a non-leading question (\"how would you know when to
take a real break?\"). No product was described before this surfaced.

**Cross-Interview Synthesis**

**Consistent Signals Across All Three Interviews**

**1. Forced session transitions are universally rejected**

All three interviewees described dismissing or ignoring timer alerts
when mid-thought. This is not a preference --- it\'s a behavioral
pattern observed across different personas and work contexts. A
non-coercive transition model is not a differentiator; it is table
stakes.

**2. Manual logging fails within one week**

Every interviewee who tried manual tracking (Toggl, calendar blocks)
abandoned it within a week. The consistent reason: retroactive logging
is perceived as guessing, and real-time logging requires meta-awareness
that disrupts the focus it\'s trying to measure. Automatic session
logging is required, not optional.

**3. Breaks default to phone use without guidance**

Two of three interviewees described phone-based breaks (social media,
YouTube) as their default. The third (the engineer) simply skips breaks.
None had a structured alternative. Break suggestions are a real gap, not
a nice-to-have.

**4. Context restoration is a self-built workaround for two of three
interviewees**

The grad student described losing context entirely after dismissing
timer alerts. The engineer built a voice memo system. The PM uses sticky
notes. None of these are elegant solutions --- they\'re
friction-generating workarounds for a real, unsolved problem.

**Insights That Changed or Refined the Product Model**

**Accumulated focus is a distinct mental model from session timers**

Interview 3 surfaced a mental model that existing Pomodoro tools do not
address at all: thinking in terms of daily total focus rather than
individual sessions. This directly validates the accumulated focus
tracking feature in the PRD and suggests it may be the differentiating
feature for professional users, not just a secondary add-on.

**Session length flexibility is a prerequisite for engineering persona
adoption**

Interview 2 made clear that standard 25-minute Pomodoro intervals are a
non-starter for deep technical work. Custom session durations are not a
feature request --- they are a prerequisite for the software engineer
persona to engage with the product at all.

**What Was NOT Validated**

Social or team accountability features were not raised by any
interviewee as a desire or pain point. This aligns with the PRD\'s
decision to exclude them from v1 scope.

Calendar integration was mentioned in passing by Interview 3, but when
asked whether she\'d pay for it or go out of her way for it, the
response was lukewarm. Not a v1 priority.

**Mom Test Self-Assessment**

**Strengths:** All three interviews stayed in the past and behavioral
domain. The accumulated focus insight from Interview 3 emerged without
any product framing --- the strongest possible signal.

**Weaknesses:** Interview 1 briefly slipped into a product description
moment near the end (\"we\'re building something that\...\"). The
interviewee\'s subsequent responses became slightly more positive and
should be weighted accordingly. The three interviewees are also
relatively homogeneous --- all knowledge workers; no tradespeople or
hourly workers represented.

**Next conversations to have:** A freelancer who tracks billable hours
(would test the tagging and analytics features more directly). A manager
overseeing remote workers (accountability angle). Someone who has
successfully maintained a Pomodoro habit long-term (understand why it
stuck for them).
